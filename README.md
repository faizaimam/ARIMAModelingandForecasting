# ARIMAModelingandForecasting
The project is based on Daily New Cases data of Covid-19 for three South Asian countries- Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan.
Using this data, a trend analysis of each country and a comparison among them is made.
Removing stationarity when needed, and using ACF and PACF plots, appropriate ARIMA models are selected.
Among the selected models, based on the lowest AIC, one model for each country is selected.
A further diagnostic test is done to ensure that the selected models are in fact the best-fitted models.
Forecasting based on ARIMA models is done for the next six months.
